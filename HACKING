HOW TO RELEASE A NEW FEATURE/BUG FIX

We assume you already issued a pull request (of a branch) and got a LGTM message. We also assume that you have created a branch on oq-ui-api repo (also if the actual change are related to a different repo)

1) Once you have identified the next release number (e.g. v0.7.0), update oq-ui-api/bin/geonode_installation.sh. E.g.

export GEM_OQ_UI_API_GIT_REPO=git://github.com/gem/oq-ui-api.git
export GEM_OQ_UI_API_GIT_VERS=v0.7.0
export GEM_OQ_UI_CLIENT_GIT_REPO=git://github.com/gem/oq-ui-client.git
export GEM_OQ_UI_CLIENT_GIT_VERS=v0.7.0
export GEM_OQ_UI_GEOSERVER_GIT_REPO=git://github.com/gem/oq-ui-geoserver.git
export GEM_OQ_UI_GEOSERVER_GIT_VERS=v0.7.0

PS. Remember to update all the GEM_OQ_UI_* variables and to do that also if your change is not related to the oq-ui-api repo

2) Commit and push the previous change on your branch
git commit -am "updated release number"
git push

Repeat the following steps for each repo (oq-ui-api, oq-ui-client, oq-ui-geoserver)
3) Merge the branch (on github or from CLI) into master

4) Tag all the repositories with the release number. E.g.

git checkout master # assuming you are in the oq-ui-api repo
git pull origin master # to get the last changes
git tag v0.7.0_inst   # only on oq-ui-api
git tag v0.7.0
git push --tags origin master
