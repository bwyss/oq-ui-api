      $ git clone git://github.com/gem/oq-ui-api.git
      $ cd oq-ui-api
  * checkout the required version of the script with the command
      $ git checkout <version_name>_inst
    where <version_name> is the version that you want to install
  * copy the bin/geonode-installation.sh file into the previous created staff dir:
      $ cp bin/geonode-installation.sh ../geonode_staff
  * go into 'geonode_staff' directory and run the installation script:
      $ cd ../geonode_staff
      $ ./geonode-installation.sh
    NOTE: to run some parts the script require root access so it will ask your
    password to 
  * the script will ask you "Public site url or public IP address ..."; you must
    answer with the public name of the machine (see above) <SITE_HOST>
  * after a while the script will ask to you if you want create a superuser
    account for administrative purposes, answer "yes" and create it.
  * after the installation you can browse to "http://<SITE_HOST>" url to see 
    the local geonode homepage, to "http://<SITE_HOST>/geoserver" to see local geoserver
    homepage and to "http://<SITE_HOST>/FaultedEarth" to access FE application.

  new lines of log on the display you can fill safe.
